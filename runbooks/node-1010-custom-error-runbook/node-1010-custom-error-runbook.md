# Runbook: Node rejects a transaction ("1010: Invalid Transaction: Custom error: N")

A transaction is built, proved and balanced, and the node turns it away at submission. The DApp
sees only `Transaction submission error`. The node's reason, `Custom error: N`, is two causes
down the error chain, where `err.message` doesn't reach. Find the `RPC-CORE:
submitAndWatchExtrinsic` line already in your console (or print `String(err)`), decode N with the
script below, and match it to a fix. The numbers depend on the node version. Node 2.x drops or
renames ten of node 1.0.x's codes, and the docs' "Decode 1010 errors" page lists the 2.x table,
although preview, preprod and mainnet run node 1.0.400.

## Symptom

Everything here is the wallet SDK running in your own process (Node.js or the page). Browser
consoles and the DApp Connector path, where a browser wallet submits for you, weren't
reproduced. Each item below was reproduced on a local network running node 1.0.400 unless
marked otherwise.

- **The wallet SDK rejects with a message that has no reason** (→ Diagnose 1):

  ```text
  (FiberFailure) SubmissionError: Transaction submission error
  ```

  That's all `err.name` and `err.message` hold. `err.stack` and `JSON.stringify(err)` don't
  contain the node's code either, and `err.cause` is `undefined`. `String(err)`, and
  `console.error(err)` in Node.js, print the whole chain:

  ```text
  (FiberFailure) SubmissionError: Transaction submission error
      at …
    [cause]: SubmissionError: Transaction submission failed
        at …
      [cause]: RpcError: 1010: Invalid Transaction: Custom error: 182
  ```

- **The console has the code even when the DApp swallows the error** (→ Diagnose 1). The RPC
  client logs this to stderr on every rejection:

  ```text
  RPC-CORE: submitAndWatchExtrinsic(extrinsic: Extrinsic): ExtrinsicStatus:: 1010: Invalid Transaction: Custom error: 196
  ```

- **Midnight.js scoped transactions** put the same chain into their message (→ Diagnose 1):
  `Unexpected error submitting scoped transaction '<name>': (FiberFailure) SubmissionError: …`
  (midnight-js 4.1.1 builds it with `String(err)`; from source, not reproduced).
- **A client that shows the raw JSON-RPC response** (→ Diagnose 2; from `servicedesk#54`, not
  reproduced):

  ```json
  {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":4,"error":{"code":1010,"message":"Invalid Transaction","data":"Custom error: 168"}}
  ```

- **No code at all, and the cause is `TransactionInvalidError`** (→ Remediation 3):

  ```text
  (FiberFailure) SubmissionError: Transaction submission error
    [cause]: TransactionInvalidError: Transaction is invalid and was rejected by the node
  ```

  The node accepted the transaction into its pool and dropped it when it built the block, so no
  code comes back. Reproduced with two wallet instances on one seed spending the same DUST while
  the first transaction was still pending. The same spend made after the first one was in a
  block got `Custom error: 196` instead.
- **The node log, if you run the node** (→ Diagnose 2). Mempool rejections of a malformed
  transaction print the node's error, and the line before it has the ledger's own text. Ledger
  state failures print "guaranteed execution would fail", either at submission ("from mempool")
  or when the block is built ("at pre-dispatch", the case with no code above):

  ```text
  Transaction malformed: transaction application error detected during verification: Intent TTL has expired. TTL: Timestamp(1791320261), Current block: Timestamp(1791320580)
  🚫 Rejected transaction 7a041e26… from mempool: Transaction Error: Malformed(TransactionApplicationError)
  🚫 Rejected transaction e5505985… from mempool: guaranteed execution would fail: ReplayProtectionViolation(IntentAlreadyExists)
  🚫 Rejecting transaction 7e428a89… at pre-dispatch: guaranteed execution would fail: DustDoubleSpend(DustNullifier(a244c441…))
  ```

**Not this runbook:**

- **1010 with text instead of a number:** `1010: Invalid Transaction: Transaction would exhaust
  the block limits` is a Substrate check, not the Midnight ledger. See the
  [batched deploy runbook](../contract-batched-deploy-runbook/contract-batched-deploy-runbook.md)
  (`servicedesk#225`; not reproduced here).
- **`disconnected from … Normal Closure` and no code:** the connection closed before
  the node answered, so there is no verdict. Seen when the same transaction was resubmitted
  straight after a rejection; the node never logged the second attempt. Retry after a few seconds.

## Root cause

**How the number gets into the error** (from source):

1. The node validates every submitted transaction against the ledger (`validate_unsigned` in
   `pallet_midnight`). A failure is a `LedgerApiError`, which the node turns into a `u8` with
   `impl From<LedgerApiError> for u8` and returns as `InvalidTransaction::Custom(code)`
   (`pallets/midnight/src/lib.rs` L557-574). Ledger variants the node has no code for become
   its catch-all, `Invalid.UnknownError` (109) or `Malformed.UnknownError` (139)
   (`conversions.rs`).
2. Substrate's author RPC answers with code 1010, message `Invalid Transaction` and data
   `Custom error: N` (`author/error.rs` L107-111). The 1010 is Substrate's envelope; the N is
   Midnight's.
3. The RPC client (polkadot.js) turns that into `RpcError: 1010: Invalid Transaction: Custom
   error: N`, and the wallet SDK wraps it twice: `SubmissionError: Transaction submission failed`
   (`wallet-sdk-node-client`), then `SubmissionError: Transaction submission error`
   (`wallet-sdk-capabilities`). The promise API rejects with an Effect `FiberFailure`, whose
   `message` is the outermost text and which sets no `cause`; only its `toString()` renders the
   chain (`effect` 3.22.0, `internal/runtime.ts` L223-227).

Ledger state is checked twice. At submission the pool validates the transaction against the
current state, and a failure comes back as 1010. When a block is built, `pre_dispatch` checks it
again against the state at that point (`lib.rs` L476). A failure there is logged by the node,
but the client only sees `TransactionInvalidError`, with no code. Two transactions that are each
valid on their own, such as two spends of the same DUST, both pass the first check while
neither is in a block yet.

**Why the code depends on the node version.** The table is in the node. Nodes 1.0.0 to 1.0.400
share one table of 120 codes. Node 2.0.0-rc.x has 154, and 2.1.0-rc.x and `main` have 155 (140
was added in 2.1.0-rc.1). Seven 1.0.x codes are gone in 2.x, and three more become the
`…Unknown` case of a finer split:

| 1.0.x | Name on 1.0.x | On node 2.x |
|---|---|---|
| 168 | `Malformed.FeeCalculation` | gone: 231 `OutsideTimeToDismiss`, 232 `BlockLimitExceeded` |
| 182 | `Malformed.TransactionApplicationError` | gone: 228 `IntentTtlExpired`, 229 `IntentTtlTooFarInFuture`, 230 `IntentAlreadyExists` |
| 186 | `Malformed.EffectsCheckFailure` | gone: 212 to 218 |
| 187 | `Malformed.DisjointCheckFailure` | gone: 225 to 227 |
| 188 | `Malformed.SequencingCheckFailure` | gone: 219 to 224 |
| 193 | `Invalid.ReplayProtectionViolation` | gone: 242 TTL expired, 243 TTL too far ahead, 244 intent already exists |
| 205 | `SystemTransaction.ReplayProtectionFailure` | gone: 245 to 247 |
| 103 | `Invalid.Zswap` | stays as `Invalid.Zswap.Unknown`; adds 239 to 241 and 250 |
| 127 | `Malformed.Zswap` | stays as `Malformed.Zswap.Unknown`; adds 235 to 238 |
| 174 | `Malformed.MalformedContractDeploy` | stays as `….Unknown`; adds 233 and 234 |

140, 156, 157, 248 and 249 are new. So `Custom error: 231` (`servicedesk#117`) came from a node
2.0.0-rc.4 devnet; on node 1.0.x the same failure is 168. Stagenet already runs node 2.0.0
(`system_version` `2.0.0-d9729c13`).

**Two docs pages disagree.** [Node error codes](https://docs.midnight.network/nodes/error-codes)
matches node 1.0.400 (only 211, `SystemTransaction.MerkleTreeError`, is missing).
[Decode 1010 errors](https://docs.midnight.network/how-to/decode-1010-transaction-rejection-errors)
is the 2.x table: it marks 168, 182, 186, 187, 188, 193 and 205 as retired and lists 212 to 250
as current. Node 1.0.400 still uses all seven (182 and 193 were reproduced on it). Use the Node
error codes page for preview, preprod and mainnet until they move to 2.x.

**Malformed or Invalid.** A `Malformed` code is about the transaction as built (structure,
proofs, signatures, balance, TTL, fees). An `Invalid` code is about the ledger state it met
(already spent, already on chain), so the question is what got there first.

## Key identifiers

- **RPC error:** `{"code":1010,"message":"Invalid Transaction","data":"Custom error: N"}`, with N
  from 0 to 255. Without `Custom error:`, the data is Substrate's own reason (for example
  `Transaction would exhaust the block limits`). Other pool codes (`author/error.rs`): 1011
  Unknown Transaction Validity, 1012 Transaction is temporarily banned, 1013 Transaction Already
  Imported, 1014 Priority is too low, 1016 Immediately Dropped (the pool is full).
- **Code ranges on node 1.0.x:** 0-11 deserialization, 50-63 serialization, 100-109 and 193-200
  `Invalid`, 110-139 and 166-192 `Malformed`, 150-155 and 165 node ledger API, 201-211 system
  transactions, 255 host API. The tables themselves are linked under Reference material.
- **Node version:** JSON-RPC `system_version`. `1.0.400-c338b9ac` on preview, preprod and
  mainnet on 2026-10-07 (the build hash isn't a public commit); the
  `midnightntwrk/midnight-node:1.0.400` image reports `1.0.400-87c0fbdb`, with the same table.
  `rpc.<network>.midnight.network` answered without a key on 2026-10-07; for their shutdown and
  Blockfrost's project token, see the
  [Blockfrost migration runbook](../indexer-blockfrost-migration-runbook/indexer-blockfrost-migration-runbook.md).
- **Wallet SDK errors:** name `(FiberFailure) SubmissionError`; messages
  `Transaction submission error` (outer) and `Transaction submission failed` (inner). With no
  node code: `TransactionInvalidError: Transaction is invalid and was rejected by the node`,
  `TransactionDroppedError` and `TransactionUsurpedError` (`wallet-sdk-node-client` 1.1.3,
  `PolkadotNodeClient.js`).
- **Node log:** `Rejected transaction <hash> from mempool: Transaction Error: …` (the node's
  error), `… from mempool: guaranteed execution would fail: …` and `Rejecting transaction <hash>
  at pre-dispatch: guaranteed execution would fail: …` (the ledger's).
- **TTL:** set by the caller. `wallet-sdk-facade` 4.1.0 requires `ttl` in `transferTransaction`
  and the `balance…Transaction` methods (its own one-hour `DEFAULT_TTL_MS` only covers DUST
  registrations and fee estimates). Midnight.js uses `ttlOneHour()`, the machine clock + 1 hour
  (`midnight-js-utils` 4.1.1), for deploy and call intents, and testkit-js's `balanceTx` defaults
  to it.
- **Transaction id:** `WalletFacade.submitTransaction` resolves only once the transaction is
  finalized, and returns `tx.identifiers().at(-1)`, which you can read before submitting.

## Diagnose (no API key)

1. **Get the code.** Search the output you already have (terminal, CI log, browser console) for
   `Custom error:` or `RPC-CORE: submitAndWatchExtrinsic`; the RPC client prints the code on
   every rejection, even when the DApp swallows the error. If the line says
   `disconnected from … Normal Closure` instead, the node never answered (see Not this runbook).
   If the cause is `TransactionInvalidError`, there is no code; go to Remediation 3. If there's
   nothing, log `String(err)` where you catch the submission error and reproduce. In a browser,
   use `String(err)`: the docs say browser consoles show only the outer message (not reproduced
   here). Reproducing submits a transaction, so an agent working for a user asks first. If you
   run the node, grep its log for `Rejected transaction` and `Rejecting transaction`.
2. **Decode it.** The script needs Node >= 20, no install, and only reads the text you give it;
   with `--rpc` it also asks the node for its version.

   ```sh
   mkdir -p /tmp/decode-1010
   curl -fsSL -o /tmp/decode-1010/decode-1010.mjs \
     https://raw.githubusercontent.com/midnightntwrk/servicedesk/main/runbooks/node-1010-custom-error-runbook/scripts/decode-1010.mjs
   node /tmp/decode-1010/decode-1010.mjs 'RpcError: 1010: Invalid Transaction: Custom error: 196'   # paste the line
   node /tmp/decode-1010/decode-1010.mjs app.log --rpc wss://rpc.preprod.midnight.network          # or a saved log
   npm run deploy 2>&1 | node /tmp/decode-1010/decode-1010.mjs                                     # or a command that exits
   ```

   For a server that keeps running, save its output first (`npm start 2>&1 | tee app.log`) and
   pass the file; the script reads stdin to the end before it prints. It finds every
   `Custom error: N`, every pool error, the no-code wallet errors and the node log lines above.
   Pass `--rpc` with the node URL the DApp uses (the `wss://` one works), so it decodes against
   that node's version, or `--node 1.0` / `--node 2.x`; without either it assumes 1.0.x and says
   so. For Blockfrost, `export BLOCKFROST_PROJECT_ID=…` first; the key is only sent to
   blockfrost.io and never printed. Exit code: 0 = explained at least one failure, 2 = found none
   it could explain (it says how to get the code out of the SDK error), 1 = it could not run.
   Example:

   ```text
   Code table: node 1.0.x (1.0.0 to 1.0.400). https://rpc.preprod.midnight.network runs
       1.0.400-c338b9ac.

   Custom error: 196 → Invalid.DustDoubleSpend
     Invalid: the transaction is well-formed but conflicts with the ledger state it was checked
     against.
     The DUST that pays the fee is already spent on chain. Reproduced on node 1.0.400 with two wallet
     instances on one seed: the second transaction got 196 once the first was in a block. Fix: one
     wallet instance per seed, and wait until the last transaction is on chain and the wallet has
     synced it before building the next one.
   ```

   A code that only exists on the other node version gets a pointer instead:

   ```text
   Custom error: 231 → not a code on node 1.0.x.
     On node 2.x it is Malformed.FeeCalculation.OutsideTimeToDismiss. On node 1.0.x the same failure is
     168 (Malformed.FeeCalculation). Check which node rejected the transaction (--rpc).
   ```

3. **By hand, if you can't run it:** check the node version, then look the code up on the
   [Node error codes](https://docs.midnight.network/nodes/error-codes) page for 1.0.x, or in the
   2.x source under Reference material.

   ```sh
   curl -s -H 'content-type: application/json' \
     -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"system_version","params":[]}' \
     https://rpc.preprod.midnight.network
   ```

4. **Match it to a cause.** The failures that come up in practice, on node 1.0.x:

   | Code | Name | What happened | Seen in | Fix |
   |---|---|---|---|---|
   | 182 | `Malformed.TransactionApplicationError` | Intent TTL expired or too far ahead, or the intent already exists; the node log says which | reproduced; `servicedesk#235` (the same text in a node log) | Remediation 1 |
   | 193 | `Invalid.ReplayProtectionViolation` | Replay protection against ledger state; in practice the transaction was submitted again after it landed | reproduced | Remediation 2 |
   | 196 | `Invalid.DustDoubleSpend` | The DUST paying the fee is already spent on chain | reproduced | Remediation 3 |
   | none | `TransactionInvalidError` | Rejected when the block was built, e.g. the same DUST spent twice while both were pending | reproduced | Remediation 3 |
   | 170 | `Malformed.InvalidDustSpendProof` | The DUST spend proof didn't verify, which is as likely a disagreement on DUST state as a bad proof | `servicedesk#150`, `servicedesk#52` | Remediation 4 |
   | 168 | `Malformed.FeeCalculation` | Too slow to validate for its size, or too big for a block | `servicedesk#100` | Remediation 5 |
   | 186 | `Malformed.EffectsCheckFailure` | The transaction's effects don't match what its contract calls claim | `servicedesk#37` | Remediation 6 |

   On node 2.x look for their successors (table under Root cause). Anything else → Remediation 7.

## Remediation

1 to 3 were reproduced; 4 to 6 come from worked cases.

1. **TTL (182; 228, 229, 242 and 243 on 2.x).** Build the transaction again and submit it
   promptly, with a TTL a little in the future. Now + 30 minutes was accepted; now - 5 minutes
   and now + 30 days were rejected (the local node allowed up to block time + 14 days). The TTL
   is whatever your code passes as `ttl`, or midnight-js's `ttlOneHour()`. Both come from the
   client's clock, so a clock that's behind by more than an hour produces expired TTLs (from
   source, not reproduced). On a public network you won't see the node log: compare the `ttl`
   you passed with the time you submitted, and if that was fine, 182 can also mean the intent
   already exists (Remediation 2).

   *Trade-off:* a signed transaction that waits (offline signing, a queue) can expire; build it
   close to submission.
2. **Already on chain (193; 230 and 244 on 2.x).** The transaction landed, and usually a retry
   resubmitted it. Submitting the same transaction again while it was still pending was harmless:
   both calls resolved with the same id. After it was in a block, the same resubmission got 193.
   Keep the id before the first submission (`tx.identifiers().at(-1)` on the finalized
   transaction is what `submitTransaction` returns), and before retrying, check whether it's on
   chain. With midnight-js, race `publicDataProvider.watchForTxData(txId)` against a timeout of a
   few blocks, because it never times out on its own. Treat 193 after a retry as "the first one
   went through", and build a new transaction for a real retry.

   *Trade-off:* safe retries mean storing the id before the first submission.
3. **DUST already spent (196, or `TransactionInvalidError` with no code).** Run one wallet
   instance per seed. Two instances on one seed built from the same state picked the same DUST:
   while the first transaction was pending, the second was dropped when the block was built
   (`TransactionInvalidError`), and once the first was in a block, the same spend got 196. Wait
   until the last transaction is on chain (`submitTransaction` resolves at finalization) and the
   wallet has synced it before building the next one from another instance.

   *Trade-off:* that serializes submissions per seed. Separate wallets (seeds), each with its own
   DUST, would allow parallel submissions (not tested).
4. **DUST spend proof (170).** Let the wallet finish syncing and build again. If every
   transaction on the network gets 170, faucet included, the problem is on the network's side, not
   in the DApp: open a servicedesk issue. In `servicedesk#150` (stagenet, ledger v9) it was an
   indexer bug, fixed by
   [midnight-indexer#1443](https://github.com/midnightntwrk/midnight-indexer/pull/1443). If only
   your client fails, compare its ledger with the node's (`npm ls @midnight-ntwrk/ledger-v8`
   against the `midnight_ledgerVersion` RPC). In `servicedesk#52` a client on ledger-v8 8.0.3 got
   170 on preprod while 8.1.0 deployed, though the cause wasn't established. A transfer proved by
   proof server 8.0.3 was accepted by node 1.0.400, so an older proof server alone doesn't cause
   it.
5. **Fee check (168 on 1.0.x; 231 and 232 on 2.x).** On node 1.0.x one code covers two ledger
   errors, and the node log says which. "Exceeded the maximum time to dismiss for transaction
   size" means the transaction would take longer to validate than its size allows. Fewer intents
   per transaction may help: in `servicedesk#100` a third intent the SDK added to a balanced swap
   tipped it over, and the app couldn't avoid it. The limit is a network parameter, so nothing on
   the client raises it; `servicedesk#100` was closed as needing a governance decision. "Exceeded
   block limit in transaction fee computation" means it's too big for a block; for a deploy, see
   the
   [batched deploy runbook](../contract-batched-deploy-runbook/contract-batched-deploy-runbook.md).
   On a public network you won't see the node log: if it's a deploy, start with the batched deploy
   runbook, otherwise treat it as the time-to-dismiss check.

   *Trade-off:* splitting one transaction into several gives up atomicity; a later one can fail
   after an earlier one landed.
6. **Effects check (186; 212 to 218 on 2.x).** midnight-js 4.0.4 put the offer for a fallible
   claim in the guaranteed section (`servicedesk#37`), and 4.1.1 fixed it. Upgrade to the
   [support matrix](https://docs.midnight.network/relnotes/support-matrix) version. Otherwise open
   an issue with the contract and the full error.

   *Trade-off:* midnight-js 4.1.1 goes with compact-runtime 0.16.0, so the rest of the project
   moves to the matrix set with it (see the
   [toolchain version mismatch runbook](../toolchain-version-mismatch-runbook/toolchain-version-mismatch-runbook.md)).
7. **Anything else.** Run the decoder, read the name and category, and check the code's row on
   the Node error codes page. If that doesn't explain it, open an issue at the
   [servicedesk front door](https://github.com/midnightntwrk/servicedesk/issues/new/choose) with
   `String(err)`, the decoder's output, the node's `system_version` and, if you have them, the
   node log lines around `Rejected transaction`.

## Upstream follow-ups

- [servicedesk#225](https://github.com/midnightntwrk/servicedesk/issues/225): the SDK error that
  reaches the DApp doesn't carry the node's reason in `message`.
- midnight-docs (to file): the "Decode 1010 errors" page lists node 2.x codes as current and marks
  codes node 1.0.400 still uses as retired; its note that 168 was "replaced by 155" is wrong (155
  exists on both, and 2.x splits 168 into 231 and 232); the Node error codes page is missing 211.
