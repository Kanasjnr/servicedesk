/**
 * watch-sync.ts: log a wallet's sync position while it syncs, so a slow sync can be told apart from a
 * stuck one. Copy it into your app and call it right after `wallet.start(...)`:
 *
 *   const stop = watchSync(wallet);
 *   const state = await wallet.waitForSyncedState();
 *   stop();
 *
 * Every 30 s it prints one line per sub-wallet: events applied out of the newest event the indexer
 * reported, the rate since the last line, and the time left at that rate. If a sub-wallet that isn't
 * synced yet doesn't move for 10 minutes, it prints a warning instead: that sync is stuck, not slow.
 * Each sub-wallet is watched on its own, because a shielded wallet at the tip keeps moving with every
 * new block while DUST can be stuck far behind. Time the process spends suspended (a laptop asleep)
 * isn't counted: after a wake-up it says so, and only awake time adds up towards the 10 minutes.
 *
 * It only reads `progress`, which every sub-wallet state exposes in wallet SDK 1.2.0. Nothing is
 * sent, signed or stored. Plain `console`; pass your own logger if you have one.
